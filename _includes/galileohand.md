# Galileo Hand Mechanical

***

Galileo Hand is a low cost (under $100), open source, mechanical, 3D printed, prosthetic hand/arm which is distributed as a do it yourself kit (DIY) so that people with disabilities can contact their local maker to help them build the system. The materials are designed to be low cost and easily accessible so that it is not only easy to build, but also easy to repair anywhere in the world.

We are currently in the prototype phase where we already have a working body powered version and are doing controlled tests with an experienced prosthetic user (25+ years of usage) who is giving us great feedback about improvements while in parallel working on the bionic version with a recent amputee.

## Body Powered Version

This version uses body power to activate/control the grasp, all the components are low cost and should be available in any hardware store (screws, bolts, elastic thread, etc.) while the rest are 3D printed. The total cost of producing it should be under $50.

### Rotating Thumb & Wrist

We want to keep as much functionality in the mechanical version due to its low cost and high reliability, which is why we incorporated a thumb rotation module so that the mechanical hand can do 4 types of grasping, allowing for things such as: drinking water, writing, picking up small objects, carrying a toolbox, reading a newspaper, using two hands to open a bottle, picking up medium size objects, to mention a few.
