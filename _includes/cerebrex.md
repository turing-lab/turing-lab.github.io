# Cerebrex
***

Cerebrex is an Educational Videogame developed jointly by [Galileo University](http://turing.galileo.edu) (research) and Elemental Geeks (implementation), which makes it research based and gamers tested. It focuses on fun and motivation and targets four main cognitive areas: Numeric, Rational, Memory and Visuospatial. 
Elemental Geeks ran a few marketing campaigns using the Cerebrex Minigames where  over 20,000 adults played the games. Galileo University has done controlled interventions using Cerebrex with about 1,000 students and 4 academic papers have been published.

## What is Cerebrex?
Cerebrex is a Serious Educational Videogame developed jointly by Galileo University (research) and Elemental Geeks (implementation), which makes it research based and gamers tested. Although we believe anyone can use it, it has been mainly tested with Guatemalan elementary 4th to 6th grade students.


Cerebrex focuses on four main cognitive areas: Numeric, Rational, Memory and Visuospatial. It offers players three mini-games per area totaling 12 games. Each mini-game does quick (one minute) mental workouts aimed at improving its main area, it starts easy and quickly levels up according to each players individual capacity until it (ideally) reaches a state of flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

Besides the mini-games, Cerebrex incorporates an online and real-time assessment platform which helps: Students assess and be responsible for their own progress. For professors, they can measure and detect areas of improvement and for researchers to build better game mechanics and evaluate performance.


The mini-games included in Cerebrex were uploaded to the Facebook platform, where a population of about 20,000 adults (aged 18+) played the games, thus allowing us to fine tune game mechanics, reward systems, and fix programming errors.
