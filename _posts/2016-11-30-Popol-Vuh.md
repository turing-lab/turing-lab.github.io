# What is the Popol Vuh Project?
***

The Popol Vuh serious game is an RPG with a turn-based
battle system that brings the Mayan stories of the Popol Vuh book into the videogame. This
software is meant to be used alongside the book to complement reading sessions. It
introduces characters, locations, terms and story elements from the book in order to
familiarize the players with the lecture and prepare them for future learning.

# Game Mechanics and Dungeon Design
***

Dungeon mechanics are being designed with the objective to test
reading comprehension. To achieve this we use the book as guide to build the dungeons in such way
that only students that are up to date with their reading can solve the puzzles. The game world is
based on book descriptions, the enemies in the game are the same creatures from the book. Since
the game is an RPG it uses a turn-based battle system that introduces battle mechanics like speed,
attack power and HP.
