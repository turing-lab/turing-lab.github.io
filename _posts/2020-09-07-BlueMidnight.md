<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span></p>lue Midnight was created as a response of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) to clean and disinfect offices, universities and hospitals. It's a rover that uses UV-C lights to disinfect and kill the virus but this light is harmful to humans. If a human is exposed to this light could have problems in the skin and in the eyes and that's why a robot is required to do this task which can be autonomous or remotely controlled.

Since this project is based on the SNARF project this allows us to create Blue Midnight in about four months. SNARF provided the rover platform and was adapted to carry and supply energy to the UVC lights.
