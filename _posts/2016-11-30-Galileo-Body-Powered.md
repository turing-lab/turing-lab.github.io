# Galileo Body Powered Hand
***
Galileo Hand is a low cost, open source body powered prosthesis planned to distribute as a do it yourself kit so that people with disabilities could contact their local maker to help them build the system. The materials are designed to be low cost and easily accessible so that it is not only easy to build, but also easy to repair anywhere in the world. The files are available for free download. Personal 3D printing and global collaboration over the Internet have enabled the creation of inexpensive prosthetic arms. There are few truly inspiring open projects collaborating globally to create and improve mechanical prostheses with 3D printing.

> Galileo Hand, Open-Source & Low-Cost (under $50) prosthetic hand.

In order to improve the functionality of 3D hand prostheses, the GalileoHand was designed to be fitted to conventional mechanical prostheses replacing the terminal device, usually consisting of hooks or clamps. Traditional action mechanism that allows the extension and flexion of the fingers through shoulder movements is maintained. A major improvement in this design is the Thumb Blocking Mechanism which allows the thumb to rotate obtaining three different types of grips: digital grip, tridigital grip and lateral pinch. This instructable contains the steps to print and assemble the Galileo Hand.
