# Galileo Bionic Hand
***

Galileo Bionic Hand is a low-cost 3D-printed prosthetic hand, which is planned to be released as a Do It Yourself kit (DIY), so that people with disabilities could contact local makers to help them to build the system. The prosthesis was designed to be easily built and repaired by anyone with no experience on prosthesis manufacturing anywhere in the world, ensuring its proper operation and removing the need to require expert support. Since, electromyography is a technique used to detect the activity of a group of muscles by measuring bio-potentials acquired by surface mounted electrodes, a controller based on this technique was implemented, allowing the user to consciously perform desired postures on the prosthesis.  Although the complexity of the controller increases the cost of development and fabrication, we are focused to keep the price range below $350 and aiming at a DIY approach where the electronic components could be distributed as a kit which includes the system built on a printed circuit board (PCB), complementing the open source files of the 3D design and the materials to build the prosthesis.

This controller takes advantage of digital signal processing and machine learning techniques, in order to integrate different systems on a single embedded controller operated through a user-friendly HMI that perfectly adapts on the user lifestyle like a wearable device. This allows the performing of more and
complex customized hand prosthetic actions, such as individual finger movements, different kinds of grasping and time based sequential actions.
