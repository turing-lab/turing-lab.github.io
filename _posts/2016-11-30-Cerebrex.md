# Game Feedback and Progress
***

A game progress system was designed as one of the main game elements to keep players immersed in the game. The system implements experience points (XP) which are needed to level up, an exponential equation was used to calculate the XP needed for the next level, making each level more difficult to reach. A progress bar indicates the total XP needed for the next level as well as the current XP earned, the maximum player level is 40.

The avatar is the player’s representation within the game and a way of self-identification. The pieces of
equipment are objects that introduce customization into the game and can be equipped to the avatar in
order to change his appearance.

## Research and Publications
***

Using Cerebrex, several studies have been conducted. One of the studies was conducted 
in a rural (low SES) school in Guatemala where
students have limited access to computers and technology. The main objective was to
assess if the involvement of students with videogames in rural schools could result in
an increase in performance and such increase could be maintained. Results indicated
that indeed there is an increase in performance and in most cases it is sustained.
